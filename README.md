======

a match-3/falling-block game made using: http://html5quintus.com

all the action is in the gh-pages branch: https://github.com/thatpixguy/matrix/tree/gh-pages

you can play it here: http://thatpixguy.github.com/matrix

this is based on a game (called matrix, if I recall) that I saw on a PC demo disk in the late 90's.
